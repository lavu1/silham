                            The CEO and Principal Consultant was among the three trainers for the Data Protection Awareness
                            Workshop for the Health Sector, organised by the Data Protection Commission and sponsored by the
                            Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (CIDRZ). The workshop was held in Kabwe from 16th to 18th
                            September at the Ibis Urban Hotel. Participants included representatives from the Ministry of Health, Zambia
                            National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI), and CIDRZ, primarily staff from the IT departments responsible for handling
                            sensitive clinical and public health personal data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The CEO presented on the Designation and Role of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as the guidelines for the appointment of DPOs under Zambia’s Data Protection Act of 2021 are yet to be released. Additionally, he discussed the Data Protection Compliance Roadmap, emphasizing the urgent need for the health sector to begin taking steps towards compliance with the Data Protection Act No. 3 of 2021.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given that the health sector processes clinical data, categorized as Sensitive Personal Data under the Act, it is crucial for the sector to prioritize compliance, as improper handling of such data could lead to potential discrimination against patients, infringing on their rights.

                        <p>
                            Reflecting on the training, the CEO remarked:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            “Firstly, I would like to thank the Data Protection Commission for their confidence in including us as part of a team of three trainers delivering this Awareness Training to such a vital sector like Health. The starting point for any Data Controller's Compliance Roadmap is an Awareness Training like the one we provided. This is especially critical for the health sector, which deals with sensitive personal data, to begin their compliance journey with such training.
                            The workshop was engaging with discussions, quizzes, case studies, and even some dancing to liven the atmosphere post-lunch! It was fun yet highly educational, as evidenced by the participants’ feedback. At Silham Consulting and Training Services, we are fully prepared to deliver such training to any organization looking to embark on their Data Protection Compliance Programme, particularly those in the health sector, due to the sensitive nature of the data they handle.”
