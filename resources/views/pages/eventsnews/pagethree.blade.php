                        <p><strong>(23rd of September, 2024)</strong> – PECB, one of the world's leading ISO certification and training providers,
                            announced a partnership with Silham Consulting. Together with the help of proficient trainers, Silham
                            Consulting will ensure the organization and distribution of PECB courses in Zambia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “This partnership addresses a particular market need. I believe that by working with Silham Consulting,
                            we can make integrations easier for organizations," said Tim Rama, CEO of PECB. “This partnership
                            enables our customers to retain tractability in long-term training decisions by providing them with an
                            independent open plan. I believe we will succeed together by combining the right technologies and
                            services," concluded Rama.

                            John M. Silungwe, CEO & Principal Consultant of Silham Consulting & Training Services, shared his thoughts on the new partnership:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            “I am delighted to have this partnership with PECB finally concluded. Being a product myself of PECB’s
                            rigorous training, I am excited at the prospect of introducing the same rigor of training to our future
                            trainees who will join us for PECB programs. The imminent operationalization of the Zambian Data Protection Act of 2021 will undoubtedly lead many data
                            protection and privacy practitioners in Zambia to seek globally recognized certifications in
                            data protection, such as PECB’s GDPR CDPO certification. At Silham Consulting, we plan to leverage
                            this opportunity to respond to market needs, riding on the PECB brand as we propel our
                            organization towards growth.”
