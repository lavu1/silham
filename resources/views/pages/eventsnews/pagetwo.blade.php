                        Silham Consulting &amp; Training Services CEO and Principal Consultant recently attended a Training of
                        Trainers Workshop organised by the Data Protection Commission with support from the African
                        Union Development Agency (AUDA) – NEPAD. The workshop was held at
                        the Intercontinental Hotel in Lusaka from 10th to 11th September, 2024.

                        The training aimed to build capacity among Data Protection Trainers in Zambia by focusing on the application of Andragogy (the method and practice of teaching adult
                        learners). The workshop was conducted by consultants from Kenya, drawing on their experience of
                        delivering Data Protection training across Africa. One of the consultants from Silham Consulting also attended.
