                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        “Once again, the knowledge and expertise in Data Protection and its relevancy to the Data
                        Governance Policy development process was recognised by the government when I was invited to
                        participate. It was a privilege to be in the same room with other stakeholders from various
                        sectors who are experts in their fields. The lessons learned from this experience will
                        undoubtedly influence future actions.”
